# Brain Visualization
This repository serves as the main repository for the Brain Visualization project. Mentor: Ipek Oguz

# Goal
Read NRRD file and visualize neural connections in the brain through diffusion tensor imaging tractography in the VR environment.

# Unity Version
Unity 2018.4LTS

# STEPS TAKEN 
* VR Environment Design - Our environment design was minimalistic. We created a black environment to host our environment in. We had our brain in the middle, sliders to the right and a file explorer to the left. We made the sliders big for the user to easily interface with it.
* NRRD Format IO w/ C# - NRRD IO is handled by external python environment (v3.7, numpy). NRRD data is saved as NPY file, and handled by Accord.io in C#. Due to Accord.ioâ€™s limitation on type (int/long only), all data are multiplied by 10^15, and saved as long, remaining decimals are truncated. After reading, all values are divided by 10^15 to approximate original values. -Lingfeng
* Display Module - In order to fit and display brain model in an efficient and timely manner, display module is separated into three components:
  * Reading Data: Reading NPY file is done in async, allowing smooth VR experience
  * Preparing Data: Selecting voxels to be displayed.
  * Displaying Data: Display data prepared by the second part. -Lingfeng
* Full Brain Model Display - At second part of display module, every other voxel in each dimension is selected and computed to approximate the represented brain model. -Lingfeng
* Partial Brain Display - At second part of display module, all voxels of selected slices are computed and handed to third part for display. -Lingfeng
* Compute tensor and track connectivity - At second part of display module, computing tensor started with selected voxel along the major axis. Computation stops when reached the end of data or any voxel without major axis. -Lingfeng
* Selection with lasers -  added laser point controlled for the Oculus controllers for the selection of items within the application.  
* File browsing - Used a file browsing asset from the Unity Asset Store to be able to select and load files within the VR environment. Modified it to work in VR.
* Slicing brain from box -
